Public repo for the blog A Month Learning——stay tuned for the post about the technical aspects of building this blog [here](https://amonthlearning.how/how-to-build-a-blog/)

All MDX files have been stripped of actual content in this version just so you can peek at the frontmatter and data schema.

NOTE: This is the WIP public repo for conversational purposes so what you see here and my current working project may not match up exactly 1:1
